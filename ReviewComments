Steps followed to refactor the code
1. Converted the given project to Maven Project
2. Followed Page object model
3. Created "TestBase" class under "base" package which contains code for driver initialization, wait and isElementPresent method
4. Created respective page classes under "page" package for every test class
5. Each page class contains the locator for every element and their getter methods. Also each page has its own constructor for PageFactory initialization
6. Each Test class has @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod methods which are calling driver creation method and killing method respectively
7. Each variable has been given a meaningful name and have used camel casing for their naming convention.
